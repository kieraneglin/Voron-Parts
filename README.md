# Kieran's Custom Voron Parts

This is a collection of Voron parts that I have designed for my V2.4 350mm^3 build. Usually, these have been designed to solve a specific problem I have encountered, but I hope they can be useful to others.

### EBB SB2209 CAN Cable Holder

My CAN cable that connected to my hotend has a different overmolding than the cable that the original holder was designed for. This model is designed for the more angular/larger cable variant.

### Z-Chain lower mount

The Z chain that came with my Magic Phoenix/MPX kit has 3 mounting holes at the bottom. The original Voron mount seems to use friction to stop the chain from moving laterally, but I wanted something a little more secure. This takes 2 M3 heat-set inserts to secure the chain to the mount.
