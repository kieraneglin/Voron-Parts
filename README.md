# Kieran's Custom Voron Parts

This is a collection of Voron parts that I have designed for my V2.4 350mm^3 build. Usually, these have been designed to solve a specific problem I have encountered, but I hope they can be useful to others.

### SunFounder 7" Screen Holder

Couldn't find one, so I remixed [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5242384) smart design by [Carpe_Diem2222](https://www.thingiverse.com/carpe_diem2222/designs) on Thingiverse. I really like it since it hides the bend radius of the cables behind an inlaid logo - very clean ðŸ˜Ž.

The [mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/dbe9f290789265d5aa7fbd9d10dd6a5793939f2a/printer_mods/revnull/rpi_7in_display_mount) is by [revnull-src](https://github.com/revnull-src) and it works REALLY well to get the display out of the way of your doors. I've included these STLs in the repo just in case, but I recommend you use the original files and instructions.

This is a TIGHT fit - if you're using ABS/ASA, consider adding a 1% X/Y shrink compensation _to every model_ in your slicer and be very careful with alignment of heat-set inserts. If you're unsure, consider using the variant that threads into plastic. My heat-set inserts are 4.7mm in diameter and 5.6mm tall - you may have to adjust accordingly.

### EBB SB2209 CAN Cable Holder

My CAN cable that connected to my hotend has a different overmolding than the cable that the original holder was designed for. This model is designed for the more angular/larger cable variant.

### Z-Chain lower mount

The Z chain that came with my Magic Phoenix/MPX kit has 3 mounting holes at the bottom. The original Voron mount seems to use friction to stop the chain from moving laterally, but I wanted something a little more secure. This takes 2 M3 heat-set inserts to secure the chain to the mount.
